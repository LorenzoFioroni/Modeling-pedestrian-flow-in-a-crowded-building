Noticable things during simulations:

- When freely moving, crossing agends seem to accumulate at one side, seemingly having a structure. This matches with pedestrian movement we've seen in the lectures.
- Adding a grid speeds up the process of agents passing one another compared to being able to move freely.
- Shifting the grid to force slalom movements slows the agents down again significantly. With 4 exits one can easily see the agents suddenly clogging each other with just this small change to the grid.
- Random obstacles are the worst.
- Adding pillars in front of the exits increases the speed-up significantly. Especially in the cases where a pillar was also placed in front of the entrance. This matches students running out the classroom as seen in the lecture
